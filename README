This is a sligthly modidied fork of the software for Brohogan's famous Arduino based geiger counter "GeigerKit". Get the original at https://sites.google.com/site/diygeigercounter/software and consider buying your kit there. Supports also the hardware variant by impexeris (http://arduino-geiger-pcb.blogspot.de/).
